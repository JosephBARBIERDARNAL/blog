Text cleaning is a common part of data analysis. You may not really want to do it but it‚Äôs necessary all the time. For example, have a look at this data set from tidyTuesday. It shows you the stock prices of some big tech companies.

``` r
big_tech_stock_prices <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-02-07/big_tech_stock_prices.csv')

Maybe you want work only with this financal data set. But at some point you will probably have to communicate your findings to someone. And if these people are anything like me, then they probably don‚Äôt immediately know which company is meant by a symbol like ‚ÄúAAPL‚Äù. Luckily, there‚Äôs another data set `big_tech_companies`. It gives us the translations we need.

``` r
big_tech_companies <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-02-07/big_tech_companies.csv')
big_tech_companies

#> 14 TSLA         Tesla, Inc.
```

Ah nice. This translates all of the abbreviations. But if you wanted to communicate these translations to someone, you would probably not want to just send them this data set. You might put this into a table.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(gt)
big_tech_companies |>
  gt() |> 
  tab_header(
    title = "Big tech companies",
    subtitle = "This table shows you the symbols of the big tech companies."
  ) |> 
  gt::cols_label(
    stock_symbol = "Stock symbol",
    company = "Company"
  )
```

<img src="uncleaned_tab.png" style="width:40.0%" />

This might do for communicating the abbrevations to somebody. Personally, I find the company names a little bit verbose though. I‚Äôve never talked about ‚ÄúApple Inc.‚Äù in my life. I always just say ‚ÄúApple‚Äù. And the same goes for the other companies. In fact, I have trouble understanding which company ‚ÄúInternational Business Machines Corporation‚Äù is. I‚Äôve only heard the common abbreviation IBM.

So, it‚Äôs probably best if we clean up our text labels to make our table nicer. And that‚Äôs exactly where text cleaning techniques comes into play. Let‚Äôs dive into this week‚Äôs blog post and I‚Äôll show you how that works.

## Remove texts

The `stringr` package has excellent functions to make our labels a little bit nicer. First let‚Äôs remove all the `Inc.` and `Corporation` stuff. The premier functions from `stringr` to remove texts are `str_remove()` and `str_remove_all()`. The latter removes all occurences of a given text whereas the former only removes the first occurence. Thus, most of the time it‚Äôs best to use `str_remove_all()`.

``` r
big_tech_companies |>
  mutate(
    company = str_remove_all(company, "Inc.|Corporation")
  ) 
#> # A tibble: 14 √ó 2
#>    stock_symbol company                           
#>    <chr>        <chr>                             
#>  1 AAPL         "Apple "                          
#>  2 ADBE         "Adobe "                          
#>  3 AMZN         "Amazon.com, "                    
#>  4 CRM          "Salesforce, "                    
#>  5 CSCO         "Cisco Systems, "                 
#>  6 GOOGL        "Alphabet "                       
#>  7 IBM          "International Business Machines "
#>  8 INTC         "Intel "                          
#>  9 META         "Meta Platforms, "                
#> 10 MSFT         "Microsoft "                      
#> 11 NFLX         "Netflix, "                       
#> 12 NVDA         "NVIDIA "                         
#> 13 ORCL         "Oracle "                         
#> 14 TSLA         "Tesla, "
```

Here, we removed all the `Inc.` and `Corporation` labels with `str_remove_all()`. The first argument of that function is the column we want to remove texts from (in this case that‚Äôs `company`.) The second argument is the pattern we want to remove. But here we have to be careful. We have to use **regex** to remove things.

For starters, we want to remove ‚ÄúInc.‚Äù **AND** ‚ÄúCorporation‚Äù. This means we had to tell `str_remove_all()` to look for either of these words. Here, we did that by using the `|` symbol.

But we have actually made a mistake here. üò± Look what happens if I use the same pattern in `str_remove_all()` on the text ‚ÄúApple Incorporation‚Äù. In theory, it should not remove anything because the text ‚ÄúInc.‚Äù isn‚Äôt even in there. But check out what happens.

``` r
str_remove_all("Apple Incorporation", "Inc.|Corporation")
#> [1] "Apple rporation"
```

Argh. This doesn‚Äôt look right. The function removed ‚ÄúInco‚Äù and now we‚Äôre left with ‚ÄúApple rporation‚Äù. Not exactly nice, is it? The reason for this is that `str_remove_all()` uses **regex** (like I‚Äôve mentioned before.) You can think of regex as its own powerful language. And in this language the dot `.` is not just a dot. It‚Äôs actually a symbol meaning ‚Äúany character‚Äù.

So what we‚Äôve told `str_remove_all()` is the following: *‚ÄúPlease remove any texts that correspond to one of the following patterns:*

- *‚ÄúInc‚Äù followed by any character*
- *‚ÄúCorporation‚Äù*

And `str_remove_all()` did exactly that. But it‚Äôs just not what we wanted. We wanted to remove the text ‚ÄúInc.‚Äù and the text ‚ÄúCorporation‚Äù. And we meant the dot `.` literally. So that‚Äôs why we have to tell `str_remove_all()` that. In regex. this is done by ‚Äúescaping‚Äù (that‚Äôs the technical word) it with a backslash `\`. Let‚Äôs try that.

``` r
str_remove_all("Apple Incorporation", "Inc\.|Corporation")
#> Error: '\.' is an unrecognized escape in character string (<text>:1:44)
```

Bummer. This didn‚Äôt work at all. We wanted to escape the dot but we get an error that *‚Äú`\.` is an unrecognized escape.‚Äù* That‚Äôs unfortunate but easily fixed. You see, this happens because R also uses the backslash `\` for its own purposes. For example, you may use `\n` to add line breaks in any strings that you create. So R thinks that `\.` is one of these special things. But it‚Äôs not. And then R is all confused and throws a ~~tantrum~~ error.

The way to avoid that is to tell R that we literally mean `\.`. You know, to give the other language (regex) what it needs. And we do that by adding another backslash in front of the first one. You can think of this as ‚Äúescaping the escape‚Äù. It‚Äôs yet another layer of escaping. Let‚Äôs try that.

``` r
str_remove_all("Apple Incorporation", "Inc\\.|Corporation")
#> [1] "Apple Incorporation"
```

Ahh nice. Now it works like expected. `str_remove_all()` didn‚Äôt remove anything. So let‚Äôs fix our regular expression for the whole data set. After all, we don‚Äôt want to get any unintended surprises.

``` r
big_tech_companies |>
  mutate(
    company = str_remove_all(company, "Inc\\.|Corporation")
  ) 
#> # A tibble: 14 √ó 2
#>    stock_symbol company                           
#>    <chr>        <chr>                             
#>  1 AAPL         "Apple "                          
#>  2 ADBE         "Adobe "                          
#>  3 AMZN         "Amazon.com, "                    
#>  4 CRM          "Salesforce, "                    
#>  5 CSCO         "Cisco Systems, "                 
#>  6 GOOGL        "Alphabet "                       
#>  7 IBM          "International Business Machines "
#>  8 INTC         "Intel "                          
#>  9 META         "Meta Platforms, "                
#> 10 MSFT         "Microsoft "                      
#> 11 NFLX         "Netflix, "                       
#> 12 NVDA         "NVIDIA "                         
#> 13 ORCL         "Oracle "                         
#> 14 TSLA         "Tesla, "
```

## Remove whitespaces

Now that we‚Äôve removed the `Inc.` and `Corporation` stuff, we can move on to the next thing. We want to remove all the whitespaces. You know, the spaces after some of the words. (Notice the white space followed by a quotation mark after ‚ÄúApple‚Äù and ‚ÄúAdobe‚Äù.)

``` r
big_tech_companies |>
  mutate(
    company = str_remove_all(company, "Inc\\.|Corporation")
  ) 
#> # A tibble: 14 √ó 2
#>    stock_symbol company                           
#>    <chr>        <chr>                             
#>  1 AAPL         "Apple "                          
#>  2 ADBE         "Adobe "                          
#>  3 AMZN         "Amazon.com, "                    
#>  4 CRM          "Salesforce, "                    
#>  5 CSCO         "Cisco Systems, "                 
#>  6 GOOGL        "Alphabet "                       
#>  7 IBM          "International Business Machines "
#>  8 INTC         "Intel "                          
#>  9 META         "Meta Platforms, "                
#> 10 MSFT         "Microsoft "                      
#> 11 NFLX         "Netflix, "                       
#> 12 NVDA         "NVIDIA "                         
#> 13 ORCL         "Oracle "                         
#> 14 TSLA         "Tesla, "
```

That‚Äôs excess baggage. Less remove that. We could actually include that white space in our regular expression from before.

``` r
big_tech_companies |>
  mutate(
    # Add white space in front of Inc and Corporation in pattern
    company = str_remove_all(company, " Inc\\.| Corporation")
  ) 
#> # A tibble: 14 √ó 2
#>    stock_symbol company                        
#>    <chr>        <chr>                          
#>  1 AAPL         Apple                          
#>  2 ADBE         Adobe                          
#>  3 AMZN         Amazon.com,                    
#>  4 CRM          Salesforce,                    
#>  5 CSCO         Cisco Systems,                 
#>  6 GOOGL        Alphabet                       
#>  7 IBM          International Business Machines
#>  8 INTC         Intel                          
#>  9 META         Meta Platforms,                
#> 10 MSFT         Microsoft                      
#> 11 NFLX         Netflix,                       
#> 12 NVDA         NVIDIA                         
#> 13 ORCL         Oracle                         
#> 14 TSLA         Tesla,
```

But I want to highlight another function from the `stringr` package, namely `str_trim()`. It does exactly what we want and we stops us from making our regular expression more complicated (it‚Äôs really easy to lose track of what‚Äôs going on in a regular expression.)

``` r
big_tech_companies |>
  mutate(
    company = str_remove_all(company, "Inc\\.|Corporation"),
    company = str_trim(company)
  ) 
#> # A tibble: 14 √ó 2
#>    stock_symbol company                        
#>    <chr>        <chr>                          
#>  1 AAPL         Apple                          
#>  2 ADBE         Adobe                          
#>  3 AMZN         Amazon.com,                    
#>  4 CRM          Salesforce,                    
#>  5 CSCO         Cisco Systems,                 
#>  6 GOOGL        Alphabet                       
#>  7 IBM          International Business Machines
#>  8 INTC         Intel                          
#>  9 META         Meta Platforms,                
#> 10 MSFT         Microsoft                      
#> 11 NFLX         Netflix,                       
#> 12 NVDA         NVIDIA                         
#> 13 ORCL         Oracle                         
#> 14 TSLA         Tesla,
```

Nice, this gives us the exact same result. And now that we know that `str_trim()` will always get rid of all excess white space at the beginning and end of a text, we can remove more undesired words from the text. Just add another layer `str_remove_all()` before you use `str_trim()`.

``` r
big_tech_companies |>
  mutate(
    company = str_remove_all(company, "Inc\\.|Corporation"),
    company = str_remove_all(company, "(\\.com|Systems|Platforms)?,"),
    company = str_trim(company)
  ) 
#> # A tibble: 14 √ó 2
#>    stock_symbol company                        
#>    <chr>        <chr>                          
#>  1 AAPL         Apple                          
#>  2 ADBE         Adobe                          
#>  3 AMZN         Amazon                         
#>  4 CRM          Salesforce                     
#>  5 CSCO         Cisco                          
#>  6 GOOGL        Alphabet                       
#>  7 IBM          International Business Machines
#>  8 INTC         Intel                          
#>  9 META         Meta                           
#> 10 MSFT         Microsoft                      
#> 11 NFLX         Netflix                        
#> 12 NVDA         NVIDIA                         
#> 13 ORCL         Oracle                         
#> 14 TSLA         Tesla
```

This gives us nice results. We have removed ‚Äú.com‚Äù, ‚ÄúSystems‚Äù, ‚ÄúPlatforms‚Äù, and all the ‚Äú,‚Äù. But it required doing a complicated thing. Let‚Äôs go through it step by step. First, let‚Äôs just put ‚Äú.com‚Äù (don‚Äôt forget to escape the point), ‚ÄúSystems‚Äù, ‚ÄúPlatforms‚Äù into the pattern with `|` in between.

``` r
big_tech_companies |>
  mutate(
    company = str_remove_all(company, "Inc\\.|Corporation"),
    company = str_remove_all(company, "\\.com|Systems|Platforms"),
    company = str_trim(company)
  )

This works, but it also leaves the commas in. So let‚Äôs add this comma too.

``` r
big_tech_companies |>
  mutate(
    company = str_remove_all(company, "Inc\\.|Corporation"),
    # comma added at the end
    company = str_remove_all(company, "\\.com|Systems|Platforms,"),
    company = str_trim(company)
  ) 
#> # A tibble: 14 √ó 2
#>    stock_symbol company                        
#>    <chr>        <chr>                          
#>  1 AAPL         Apple                          
#>  2 ADBE         Adobe                          
#>  3 AMZN         Amazon,                        
#>  4 CRM          Salesforce,

#>  6 GOOGL        Alphabet                       
#>  7 IBM          International Business Machines

#>  9 META         Meta                           
#> 10 MSFT         Microsoft                      
#> 11 NFLX         Netflix,                       
#> 12 NVDA         NVIDIA

Uhh what happened? The commas are still there. But why? Well, if you look closely you will see that the comma after ‚ÄúMeta‚Äù disappeared. Aha! So `str_remove_all()` only removed the comma when it was ‚ÄúPlatforms,‚Äù and not when it was ‚Äú.com,‚Äù or ‚ÄúSystems,‚Äù.

So let‚Äôs tell our regular expression to look for either of these three ‚Äúwords‚Äù followed by a comma. We do that by **grouping** them with `()`.

``` r
big_tech_companies |>
  mutate(
    company = str_remove_all(company, "Inc\\.|Corporation"),
    # group with ()
    company = str_remove_all(company, "(\\.com|Systems|Platforms),"),
    company = str_trim(company)
  ) 
#> # A tibble: 14 √ó 2
#>    stock_symbol company                        
#>    <chr>        <chr>                          
#>  1 AAPL         Apple                          
#>  2 ADBE         Adobe                          
#>  3 AMZN         Amazon                         
#>  4 CRM          Salesforce,                    
#>  5 CSCO         Cisco                          
#>  6 GOOGL        Alphabet                       
#>  7 IBM          International Business Machines
#>  8 INTC         Intel                          
#>  9 META         Meta                           
#> 10 MSFT         Microsoft                      
#> 11 NFLX         Netflix,                       
#> 12 NVDA         NVIDIA                         
#> 13 ORCL         Oracle                         
#> 14 TSLA         Tesla,
```

We‚Äôre almost there! This removed almost all the commas. But there are still some after ‚ÄúSalesforce‚Äù, ‚ÄúNetflix‚Äù and ‚ÄúTesla‚Äù. These are the exact companies that don‚Äôt have a ‚Äú.com‚Äù, ‚ÄúSystems‚Äù, or ‚ÄúPlatforms‚Äù in their name. So that‚Äôs why the pattern that we passed to `str_remove_all()` didn‚Äôt work on them.

So let‚Äôs add a question mark `?` after the group. This tells the regular expression that the group is optional. In other words, it doesn‚Äôt have to be there. So even if the group is not there, the comma will be removed.

``` r
big_tech_companies |>
  mutate(
    company = str_remove_all(company, "Inc\\.|Corporation"),
    company = str_remove_all(company, "(\\.com|Systems|Platforms)?,"),
    company = str_trim(company)
  ) 
#> # A tibble: 14 √ó 2
#>    stock_symbol company                        
#>    <chr>        <chr>                          
#>  1 AAPL         Apple                          
#>  2 ADBE         Adobe                          
#>  3 AMZN         Amazon                         
#>  4 CRM          Salesforce                     
#>  5 CSCO         Cisco                          
#>  6 GOOGL        Alphabet                       
#>  7 IBM          International Business Machines
#>  8 INTC         Intel                          
#>  9 META         Meta                           
#> 10 MSFT         Microsoft                      
#> 11 NFLX         Netflix                        
#> 12 NVDA         NVIDIA                         
#> 13 ORCL         Oracle                         
#> 14 TSLA         Tesla
```

## Replace texts

Now that we‚Äôve removed all the excess baggage, let‚Äôs move on to the final thing. We want to replace the text ‚ÄúInternational Business Machines‚Äù with its abbreviations ‚ÄúIBM‚Äù. This can be done with `str_replace_all()`.

``` r
cleaned_big_tech_companies <- big_tech_companies |>
  mutate(
    company = str_remove_all(company, "Inc\\.|Corporation"),
    company = str_remove_all(company, "(\\.com|Systems|Platforms)?,"),
    company = str_replace_all(company, "International Business Machines", "IBM"),
    company = str_trim(company)
  ) 
cleaned_big_tech_companies
#> # A tibble: 14 √ó 2
#>    stock_symbol company   
#>    <chr>        <chr>     
#>  1 AAPL         Apple     
#>  2 ADBE         Adobe     
#>  3 AMZN         Amazon    
#>  4 CRM          Salesforce
#>  5 CSCO         Cisco     
#>  6 GOOGL        Alphabet  
#>  7 IBM          IBM       
#>  8 INTC         Intel     
#>  9 META         Meta      
#> 10 MSFT         Microsoft 
#> 11 NFLX         Netflix   
#> 12 NVDA         NVIDIA    
#> 13 ORCL         Oracle    
#> 14 TSLA         Tesla
```

Nice. These are much nicer labels and now we could throw them into a table. Let‚Äôs use the same code from before.

``` r
cleaned_big_tech_companies |> 
  gt() |> 
  tab_header(
    title = "Big tech companies",
    subtitle = "This table shows you the symbols of the big tech companies."
  ) |> 
  gt::cols_label(
    stock_symbol = "Stock symbol",
    company = "Company"
  )
```

<img src="cleaned_tab.png" style="width:40.0%" />

Great job! This is a nicer table. And whoever you show this too will probably have a much easier time understanding the abbreviations. That‚Äôs it for this week‚Äôs blog post. I hope this helps you with your data cleaning tasks. Enjoy the rest of your day and see you next time üëã
