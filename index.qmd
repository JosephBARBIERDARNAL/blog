Hi friend,

For the last few years, I've made hundreds of population pyramids for the last few years as [I've produced many population pyramids](https://rfortherestofus.com/2023/01/multiple-plots) as part of the annual [Oregon by the Numbers report](https://www.tfff.org/obtn). 

[Population pyramids](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/population-pyramid/), if you're not familiar with them, are graphs that allow the reader to see the breakdown of gender and age in a particular place. But before I worked on Oregon by the Numbers, I struggled to make population pyramids. I especially struggled to make population pyramids that went beyond the undistinguished plots in the tutorials I found. 

Now, with years of population pyramid making experience, I decided to a blog post and record a video showing how I make *polished* population pyramids. The blog post and video will show you how to make population pyramids that look like this:

I used some very particular techniques to make these population pyramids. Even if you never need to make a population pyramid, I think you'll get a lot out of the blog post and video.

Check it out â†’

After you've taken a look, I'd love to know what you think! Hit reply and let me know.

Cheers,

David
