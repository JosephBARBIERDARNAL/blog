Hi friend,

For the last few years, I've made hundreds of population pyramids for the last few years as [I've produced many population pyramids](https://rfortherestofus.com/2023/01/multiple-plots) as part of the annual [Oregon by the Numbers report](https://www.tfff.org/obtn). 

[Population pyramids](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/population-pyramid/), if you're not familiar with them, are graphs that allow the reader to see the breakdown of gender and age in a particular place. But before I worked on Oregon by the Numbers, I struggled to make population pyramids. I especially struggled to make population pyramids that went beyond the undistinguished plots in the tutorials I found. 

Now, with years of population pyramid making experience, I decided to a blog post and record a video showing how I make *polished* population pyramids. The blog post and video will show you how to make population pyramids that look like this:

I used some very particular techniques to make these population pyramids. Even if you never need to make a population pyramid, I think you'll get a lot out of the blog post and video.

After you've taken a look, I'd love to know what you think! Hit reply and let me know.

Cheers,

David

Hi friend,

[I wrote recently about how I revamped the process of making population pyramids for Oregon by the Numbers](https://rfortherestofus.com/2024/07/population-pyramid-part-1), the report I’ve worked on for the last several years. Rather than making one plot, I used the {patchwork} package to stitch together three parts:

- A plot for women on the left
- Age labels in the center
- A plot for men on the right

The result is a polished version of a population pyramid that I’m quite pleased with.

[The blog post I wrote about making this version of the population pyramid saw us make one for Benton county](https://rfortherestofus.com/2024/07/population-pyramid-part-1). But this is only one of the 36 counties that make up Oregon. Given that my job is to make 36 population pyramids (alongside a couple hundred other visuals), what I really need is not the code to make one population pyramid, but a function to make all population pyramids.

[I've written now about how to turn code for a single population pyramid into a function to make a population for any county](https://rfortherestofus.com/2024/07/population-pyramid-part-2). There's a video and code samples to help you make your own population pyramids.

After you've taken a look, I'd love to know what you think! Hit reply and let me know.

Cheers,

David
