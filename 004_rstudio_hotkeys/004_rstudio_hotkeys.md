# Speed up your coding workflow with RStudio hotkeys

RStudio is the premier tool to write R code. And just like any tool, the better you know RStudioâ€™s features the faster you can write code. Thatâ€™s why we decided show you the best hotkeys we use all the time.

## Donâ€™t type the pipe

Whether it is `%>%` or `|>`, it is tempting to write out the pipe letter by letter. But the pipe is such an integral part of the tidy workflow that it makes sense to give yourself a tiny speed boost whenever you use the pipe.

Just hit `ctrl` + `shift` + `M` to get the job done. Not only will this throw the pipe, it will also add surrounding white space. And if you want to use the R native pipe `|>` instead of `%>%`, then go to **Tools \> Global Options** and enable it in the **Code** tab.

## Rainbow parantheses & pane layout

These are not really hotkeys but while weâ€™re in the RStudio settings, we might as well change two things there:

- **Pane Layout**: In the Pane Layout tab, I usually try to make sure that my console is on the right and my source view (`.R` script or Quarto file) is on the left. The reason for this is simple:

  The code-file and the console output are the premier things one usually works with **most** of the time. So it makes sense to give those two things the maximum amount of space instead of shoving both of them on the left side of the panel. Donâ€™t worry, the plot panel will automatically pop up when you create a new plot and you can also open any panel manually if you need it.

- **Rainbow paranthesis & indent**: This is one of the things I use to make sure that I can clearly see indentations and which closing parenthesis belongs to which opening parenthesis. Hereâ€™s how that looks:

  You can enable these things in **Code \> Display**:

## Open documentation with F1

I have years of experience coding with R but I still need to consult the documentation on a recurring basis. The faster you get used to consulting the docs, the better. And the fastest way to consult the documentation for a given function is to click on the function in your code and hit `F1`. This will immediately open the Help Panel in RStudio.

## Rearrange your code quickly with `alt` + arrows

The fastest way to move lines of code is to highlight them and then by pressing `alt`, you can move the code via the arrow keys.

## Indent + Unindent with (shift) + Tab

This is one of those things that I can still remember clearly from the beginnings of my coding journey. I already knew that you can indent code by highlighting it with your cursor and then pressing `tab`. But sometimes I hit `tab` one too many times and had to go in to each line and remove the extra space.

As embarrassing as this may be to admit, this is the tedious thing I did for a long time. But then at some point I realized, you actually also unindent your code by pressing `shift` + `tab`. Hoorayyy. ðŸ¥³

By the way, the same trick works with a lot of keyboard shortcuts. Hit `ctrl` + `z` one too many times? Press `shift` + `ctrl` + `z` to redo what youâ€™ve just undone.

## Multiple cursors with alt + click

Ever wanted to copy an Excel column to a vector. Itâ€™s a bit annoying that you have to add additional quotation marks manually. But with multiple cursors, that becomes pretty easy.

Just hold `alt` and drag your cursor across lines where you want to use additional cursors.

## Conclusion

These were some of our most favorite little tricks within RStudio. Did we miss anything important? Feel free to let us know in the comments.
